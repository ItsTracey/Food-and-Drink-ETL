# 🍽️ Food & Drink Data ETL Pipeline

> A project focused on building a structured ETL pipeline for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing food and drink data using Python and Pandas.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This notebook is part of a data transformation project completed during the **CAPACITI Data Analyst Programme**. The goal was to ingest raw food and drink data, clean and standardize it, and prepare it for future analytical use.

## 📊 What This Project Does

The ETL pipeline follows a classic data workflow:

### 🛠️ Extract
- Loads raw food and drink data from CSV or other structured files.
- Uses **Pandas** for efficient data ingestion.

### 🧼 Transform
- Cleans missing or inconsistent values
- Converts data types (e.g., prices to floats, dates to datetime)
- Renames columns for consistency
- Applies business logic to enrich or filter data

### 🧾 Load
- Saves the cleaned data to a new CSV or dataframe
- Can be used for future analysis or integration into a dashboard
